------------------->> Life cycle of the file <<-------------------
when we edit a file it goes to the unstaged state and when we add it then it further goes to staged state, if we are satisfied with the file and don't want to do further changes then we commit it and it is saved as the milestone in the repositry.
milestones are important because we can backtrack using these milestone.
this is it.
